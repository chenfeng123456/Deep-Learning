\section{Learning Summary}
    To be honest, it's hard for me follow the teacher. Deep Learning courses requir much knowledge of matrix which is used so flexible in the videos that I was confused most of the time.\par
    Despite all of this, I still gained a lot from this week's study experience. For example, I had a rough idea of what is a neural network which seems to be a arcane and obscure object. And I also learned how to use vectorization to avoid using for-loop in order to improve the program's operating efficiency, which is widely used in Python programming.\par
